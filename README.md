CareerFoundry Achievement 4 Project: Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app, already has very good sales, but they are looking to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors in order to implement a targeted marketing strategy. Analysis of the data will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
